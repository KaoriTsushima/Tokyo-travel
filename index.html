        <h2>Amazing city Tokyo</h2>
        <h3>Tokyo Pop Culture: Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku & Omotesando</h3>
        <p>
          Most people visit these areas as a group on their first ever visit to
          Tokyo. These are some of the places to go shopping and get a feel for
          the city life in Tokyo. And these are all close to each other! The
          order that you visit depends on what you want to do at what time.
          However, Harajuku and Omotesando close earlier than Shinjuku and
          Shibuya, so it should be saved for the middle of the day rather than
          the end. Our recommendation is to visit Shinjuku first, then Harajuku
          & Omotesando, and save Shibuya for last at night.
        </p>
        <h3>Traditional Tokyo: Ueno, Asakusa, Sky Tree (Ryogoku)</h3>
        <p>
          The northeastern side of Tokyo is where the「下町 shitamachi」- the
          physically lower areas outside of what used to be the Edo Castle (now
          its ruins are part of the Imperial Palace grounds) - is located. Many
          merchants lived here, so it’s still an area where you can find old
          shops, factories and aspects of “traditional and historical Tokyo”.

              you can choose a level of spiciness (most spicy ramen is
              "Hokkyoku"). If you like spicy food, why don't you try this!
